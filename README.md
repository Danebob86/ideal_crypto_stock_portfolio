# Custom Portfolio Analysis and Dashboard

### About The Project




(Final Dashboard and Analysis)




This repo contains the steps on how to create a 5-year historical dashboard for the following cryptocurrencies (BTC, BCH, ADA, ETH, LTC, DASH), and stock indeces (S&P 500, MSCI World, NASDAQ). After pulling the data from the APIs, we merged the datasets using Pandas before performing Analysis and Projection modules. Lastly, we use the panel and dash libraries to create the dashboard. 

Problem Solved:
* As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream and investors and institutions allocate more of their money, it becomes even more important to understand the risks of investing in crypto long term. Our portfolio dashboard allows you compare the risk and return of cryptocurrency vs. stock indeces from a 5-year standpoint. Using this technique, retail traders or crypto analyst can easily run a simulation and portfolio analysis over the stocks or digital assets they choose. 

This project is for those considering diversifying their portfolio into other assets...   

A list of commonly used resources that we find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

## Usage

This project is a great tool for someone wanting to know how to get cryptocurrency or stock price data from an API to build their own dashboard. This project also allows you to compare stocks and crypto assets. The Monte Carlo simulation and Regression modules are some of the most accurate ways of showing potential returns and outcomes for the selected assets. Below you can see the Monte Carlo simulation showing a predicted outcome of your portfolio.
